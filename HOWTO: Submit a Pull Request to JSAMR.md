# HOWTO: Submit a Pull Request to JSAMR

1.  Click on the "Code" tab to load the repository's index page
2. Select the branch with your changes using the dropdown bar labelled "Branch" on the top left
3. Click on "Pull request" on the right hand side of the page (below the bright green "Clone" button) -- this will only appear if you have any changes
4. Check that the "base" is branch "master", and the "head" is your branch with the changes
5. Write a short title for your changes, and give a short summary to help code reviewers follow what you've done
6. Click "Create pull request"

@DeckOfPandas or @srees95 will go through what you've suggested, and will merge the pull request into the code base once the changes are agreed. A conversation about the changes, e.g. with comments, can be viewed in the Pull Request thread, and will send emails to everyone involved in that request.

When changes are approved, @DeckOfPandas will update the site on the server, and you'll see your changes straight away.
