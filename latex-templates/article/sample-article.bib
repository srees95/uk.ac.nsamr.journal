  abstract = {Three experiments using SAM wideband noise, SAM wideband noise bandpass
	filtered after modulation, and SAM 10 kHz pure tone were performed:1)
	open-set melody identification; 2) melodic dictation; 3) musical
	interval adjustment. Results indicate that SAM can, at suitable modulation
	frequencies, elicit a sense of pitch, and that this pitch represents
	a purely temporal phenomenon.}
